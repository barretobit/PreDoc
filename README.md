A demonstration web application built with React.js that utilizes the Hugging Face Inference API to provide a brief summary of potential related medical conditions based on user-inputted information and symptoms.

**Important Note:** This project is intended for demonstration purposes only and should **not** be used for medical diagnosis or treatment. The results are **not** medically accurate and should **not** be interpreted as medical advice. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns.

## Features

- User-friendly form for inputting age, sex, height, weight, food and drink intake scores, water consumption, lifestyle factors (coffee, alcohol, drugs, smoking), and symptoms.
- Integration with the Hugging Face Inference API to process the user's input using a language model (`mistralai/Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407`).
- Display of a brief summary of potential related medical conditions generated by the AI model.
- Clear disclaimer emphasizing the informational nature of the results.
- Basic dark mode styling.
- Responsive layout.
- Loading indicator during API requests.
- Footer that sticks to the bottom of the page.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
    - [React.js](https://react.dev/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    - [react-spinners](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spinners) - For the loading indicator.
- **API:**
    - [Hugging Face Inference API](https://huggingface.co/inference-api) - For interacting with the language model.
- **Deployment:**
    - [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - Platform for deploying and hosting the frontend.
- **Styling:**
    - CSS (with CSS variables for basic theming).

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)barretobit/PreDoc.git
    cd PreDoc
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the client directory:**

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Navigate to the client directory (if you're not already there):**

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will run the application in development mode on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

The application is designed to be easily deployed to platforms like Netlify:

1.  **Build the production-ready application:**

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm run build
    ```

    This will create a `build` folder containing the optimized static assets.

2.  **Deploy to Netlify:**
    * You can either drag and drop the `build` folder to the Netlify website or use the Netlify CLI.
    * **Continuous Deployment (Recommended):** Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify. This will automatically build and deploy your application whenever you push changes to your main branch.

## Environment Variables

For local development, create a `.env` file in the `client` directory with your Hugging Face API key:
    ```bash
    REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY
    ```

**Important:** Ensure that your `.env` file is added to your `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits of your API key.

For the deployed version on Netlify, set the `REACT_APP_API_KEY` environment variable in your Netlify site settings.

## Disclaimer

**This application is for demonstration purposes only.** The information provided is generated by an AI model and is **not** a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider for any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. Do not disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of information you have obtained from this application.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement more sophisticated UI/UX using a component library like Material UI.
- Add input validation to the form.
- Explore different Hugging Face models for potentially more relevant or accurate results (while still emphasizing the disclaimer).
- Implement a backend proxy to securely handle the API key and potentially add caching or rate limiting.
- Improve the formatting and presentation of the AI-generated results.
- Add unit and integration tests.
